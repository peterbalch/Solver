# Solver
ESP32 Equation Solving Calculator

The Solve pocket calculator solves equations numerically. You can build the calculator or you can use this Instructable as the basis of your own project that requires ESP32-WROOM-32 microprocessor, a screen and a home-made keyboard.
You can use Solve as an ordinary pocket calculator: type in an expression and it will show you the answer. Or you can type in several equations in any order and it will solve them. The equations can be non-linear and simultaneous If they contain "For Loops" then they will produce a table of answers or plot a graph.

Solver.pdf describes the project.
